# ISO 27001:2022 Implementation Project for a Financial Organization

## Introduction

This project outlines the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 for a financial organization. The goal is to develop an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that protects sensitive financial information, aligns with business objectives, and ensures regulatory compliance. This document is structured for academic purposes and GitHub presentation.

## Risk Assessment and Analysis (ISO 27005 Integration)

### Methodology

ISO 27005 provides a structured approach for information security risk management. The steps include:

1. **Context Establishment**: Define scope, stakeholders, and risk criteria.
2. **Risk Identification**: Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
3. **Risk Analysis**: Assess likelihood and impact using qualitative and quantitative methods.
4. **Risk Evaluation**: Prioritize risks against risk acceptance criteria.
5. **Risk Treatment**: Apply mitigation measures aligned with ISO 27001:2022 controls.
6. **Risk Monitoring and Review**: Continually assess and update risks.

### Sample Risks

| ID | Asset                  | Threat                           | Vulnerability                              | Potential Impact                                  |
| -- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| R1 | Customer Data          | Cyber Attack (Phishing, Malware) | Weak Authentication                        | Data breach, financial loss, regulatory penalties |
| R2 | Banking Systems        | Insider Misuse                   | Excessive privileges, lack of monitoring   | Unauthorized transactions, reputational damage    |
| R3 | IT Infrastructure      | System Outage                    | Unpatched systems, outdated hardware       | Transaction downtime, operational losses          |
| R4 | Supplier Data Exchange | Third-party Breach               | Insecure connections, weak vendor controls | Confidentiality loss, client dissatisfaction      |
| R5 | Financial Reporting    | Regulatory Non-Compliance        | Incomplete controls, manual errors         | Legal penalties, fines, reputational harm         |

### Risk Analysis

#### Qualitative Analysis

| Risk ID | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level  |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| R1      | High       | High   | Critical    |
| R2      | Medium     | High   | High        |
| R3      | Medium     | Medium | Medium      |
| R4      | Low        | High   | Medium-High |
| R5      | Low        | High   | Medium-High |

#### Quantitative Analysis (ALE and FAIR)

| Risk ID | SLE (USD) | ARO | ALE (USD) |
| ------- | --------- | --- | --------- |
| R1      | 500,000   | 0.6 | 300,000   |
| R2      | 250,000   | 0.3 | 75,000    |
| R3      | 150,000   | 0.4 | 60,000    |
| R4      | 200,000   | 0.1 | 20,000    |
| R5      | 100,000   | 0.2 | 20,000    |

### Risk Matrix

| Impact \ Likelihood | Low                  | Medium      | High          |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| High                | Medium-High (R5, R4) | High (R2)   | Critical (R1) |
| Medium              | Low                  | Medium (R3) | High          |
| Low                 | Low                  | Low         | Medium        |

## Next Steps

### 1. Map Identified Risks to ISO 27001:2022 Controls

* **R1 (Customer Data Breach)** → Controls: Access Control, Cryptography, Operations Security, Incident Management.
* **R2 (Insider Misuse)** → Controls: Organization of Information Security, Access Control, Human Resource Security, Logging & Monitoring.
* **R3 (System Outage)** → Controls: Operations Security, Business Continuity, Physical Security.
* **R4 (Third-party Breach)** → Controls: Supplier Security, Communications Security, Cryptography.
* **R5 (Regulatory Non-Compliance)** → Controls: Compliance Management, Policies, Organizational Controls.

### 2. Develop Risk Treatment Plans

* Assign responsible owners for each risk.
* Define mitigation strategies (technical, organizational, and people-based).
* Set target completion timelines and milestones.
* Example:

  * **R1**: Implement multi-factor authentication, data encryption, security monitoring. Owner: IT Security Manager. Timeline: 3 months.
  * **R2**: Enforce least privilege, conduct staff monitoring, security training. Owner: HR & IT Security. Timeline: 4 months.

### 3. Integrate Monitoring and Review Processes (ISO 27005)

* Continuous monitoring of controls effectiveness.
* Regular risk re-assessment (quarterly or after major changes).
* Periodic reporting to top management.
* Automated alerting and metrics dashboards for early detection of deviations.

### 4. Implement Mitigation Measures

* **Technical Controls**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, encryption, secure backup.
* **Organizational Controls**: Policies, procedures, internal audits, vendor management.
* **People Controls**: Security awareness training, access reviews, incident reporting procedures.

### 5. Prepare Documentation for Internal Audits and Management Review

* Document all risk assessments, treatment plans, and control implementations.
* Maintain logs of incidents, corrective actions, and lessons learned.
* Schedule management review meetings to evaluate ISMS effectiveness and resource allocation.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

* Apply PDCA cycle for ongoing improvement.
* Update risk treatment plans based on audit findings and monitoring results.
* Incorporate feedback from incidents and regulatory updates.
